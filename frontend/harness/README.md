# Design harness

A dev-only preview of the shell chrome and the shared primitive layer
(`src/ui.tsx`, `src/primitives.tsx`, `src/brand.tsx`) rendered against the
real `src/style.css` and the vendored IBM Plex fonts. It exists so a
redesign can be **seen and screenshotted** without WebKitGTK or the Wails
Go backend — the same reason the site has a design page.

It is not part of the app: it sits outside `tsconfig.json`'s `include` and
is never referenced by the app's Vite entry (`index.html` → `src/main.tsx`),
so `make check` and the shipped `frontend/dist` never touch it.

Run it:

```
cd frontend
npx vite harness --port 5199
```

Then open http://localhost:5199/. Both themes follow the OS setting
(`prefers-color-scheme`); a screenshot tool that can emulate the colour
scheme (Playwright `colorScheme: 'light' | 'dark'`) captures both.

Page previews live in `pages.html` (`pages.tsx`) — Browse, AgentPage,
Installed, Build, Validate and Settings under the shell. Overlays live in
their own entries so each gets a clean screenshot over the shell backdrop:
the run surfaces in `modals.html` (`#runpanel | #toolspanel | #chat`) and
the first-run wizard in `wizard.html` (`#0` welcome, `#1` sign-in, `#2`
runtime, `#3` done).
